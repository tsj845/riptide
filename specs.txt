types:
    - (function) annotated as (Type, Type) -> Type
    - list
    - dict
    - str
    - int
    - float
    - number (acts as shorthand for int|float)
    - bool
    - any
    - void

common methods:
    - toString : {() -> str} returns a string representation of the object, all types have this, custom types get an auto-implemented version that returns "[classname]" so if you plan to be using "toString" on custom types it's best to implement it yourself

typing:
    typing will be optional but when present will be enforced

    multiple types can be assigned to a variable when seperated by "|"

    typing contents of lists and dicts will be done with "<Type>" and "<Type, Type>" respectively

    the contents of lists and dicts may be untyped even if the variable is typed as a list or dict
    
    ```
    // basic stuff
    var x = "";
    x = 0;
    // valid as "x" is not typed and is therefore given a dynamic type
    var y : str = "";
    y = 0;
    // invalid as "y" is typed as a string and cannot be re-typed
    var z : str|int = "";
    z = 0;
    // valid as "z" is typed to allow both strings and integers to be stored in it
    z = true; // fails as "z" is not set to allow boolean values

    // lists and dicts
    var l1 : list = [];
    l1.push("x");
    l1.push(0);
    // valid as "l1" is typed only as a list and the contents are not specified
    var l2 : list<any> = [];
    l2.push("x"); // valid
    l2.push(0); // when contents are typed as "any" the first type to be stored in the container becomes the only type allowed from that point on

    var d1 : dict = {};
    d1["x"] = 0;
    d1[0] = "x";
    // valid as the contents of "d1" are not typed
    var d2 : dict<str> = {};
    d2["x"] = 0;
    d2["y"] = "z"; // valid as only the keys of "d2" are typed
    d2[0] = "x"; // fails as the keys of "d2" must be strings
    
    // when a container has it's contents typed as "void" the type is ignored, this allows you to only type a dictionaries values while leaving keys to be anything
    var d3 : dict<void, str> = {};
    d3["x"] = "y";
    d3[0] = "z"; // valid as the keys of "d3" are not typed
    d3[true] = false; // fails as the values of "d3" are typed to only accept strings

    var d4 : dict<str, int> = {};
    d4["x"] = 0; // works as expected
    d4[0] = 0; // fails
    d4["y"] = "x"; // fails
    d4[0] = "z"; // fails
    ```

special built-ins:
    - undefined - matches any type and is used as a placeholder for uninitiallized values

typing - restrictions:
    restrictions can be imposed upon the values of certain types when typing

    note that not all types can have restrictions, for example the "bool" type, any restriction on it would be the same as just making it constant and therefore are not useful

    restrictions are placed within parentheses directly after the type ex: number(), string()

    availibility:
        number : (low, high) - each are optional but at least one must be present, when low is present the number cannot be below it, when high is present the number cannot be above it, the comma is required ex: number(,high) number(low,) number(low,high)

        string : (value *[|value]) - the string stored in the variable must be equal to a "value", a warning is emitted if there are repetitions

built in functions:
    - pow : {(n : number, power : number) -> number} returns "n" raised to the power of "power"
    - sqrt : {(n : number) -> number} returns the quare root of "n"
    - floor : {(n : number) -> int} returns "n" rounded down
    - ceil : {(n : number) -> int} returns "n" rounded up
    - round : {(n : number, places : int(0,) = 0) -> number} returns "n" rounded to "places" decimal digits

built in objects:
    console:
        - log : {(*items) -> void} logs every item in "items" to the console using the default color
        - warn : {(*items) -> void} logs every item in "items" to the console using the warning color
        - err : {(*items) -> void} logs every item in "items" to the console using the error color
        - good : {(*items) -> void} logs every item in "items" to the console using the good color

        - readline : {() -> str} returns a string obtained from input to stdin
        - read : {(characters : int(-1,) = -1) -> str} returns the next "characters" characters from stdin, blocks if there aren't enough characters remaining, if "characters" is less than zero returns all remaining characters from stdin without blocking

built in libraries:
    json:
        # note that while stringify will work on custom types when parse is used on the stringified object a plain "dict" will be returned
        - stringify : {(data) -> str} stringifies data into a JSON format
        - parse : {(string : str) -> any} parses a JSON string into an object

        //
    
    random:
        - seed : {(seed : int = 0) -> void} seeds the generator
        - random : {() -> float} returns a float from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (exclusive)
        - randint : {(low : number, high : number, step : number = 1) -> int} returns an integer between "low" (inclusive) and "high" (inclusive) at "step" intervals, performs a floor operation on all arguments before they are used
        - randrange : {(low : number, high : number, step : number = 1) -> number} returns a number between "low" (inclusive) and "high" (exclusive) at "step" intervals
        - shuffle : {(l : list) -> void} shuffles list "l" in place
        - choice : {(l : list) -> any} returns a random item from list "l"
    
    fs:
        - open : {(path : str, mode : str, encoding : int(0,1) = 0) -> fs.File} returns a File object
        - writeFile : {(path : str, contents : str|list<int(0,255)>) -> void} replaces the contents of the specified file with "contents", creates a new file if it doesn't already exist
        - readFile : {(path : str, encoding : int(0,1) = 0) -> str|list<int(0,255)>} reads the contents of the specified file
        - delFile : {(path : str) -> void} deletes the specified file, throws if the operation fails
        - mkDir : {(path : str) -> void} creates a directory with the specified path, throws if the operation fails
        - rmDir : {(path : str) -> void} deletes the specified directory and all its contents, throws if the operation fails

        File:
            - name : {str} file name and extension
            - path : {str} path to file
            - ext : {str} file extension
            
            - read : {(n : int(-1,) = -1) -> str|list<int(0,255)>} reads the specified number of characters/bytes from the file
            - write : {(data : str|list<int(0,255)>) -> void} writes the given data to the file
            - seek : {(pos : int = 0, anchor : int(0,2) = 0) -> int} seeks to the given position relative to the given anchor, returns the new position relative to the begining of the file
            - tell : {() -> int} returns the position relative to the begining of the file

            - truncate : {(count : int(0,) = 0) -> void} truncates the file to the given number of characters/bytes

            - flush : {() -> void} flushes the file
            - close : {() -> void} closes and flushes the file

errors:
    - errors are raised when either the "halt" or "raise" keyword is encountered

    - when "halt" is encountered an un-catchable error is raised causing the program to stop execution and print a stack trace

    - when "raise" is encountered a catchable error is raised which can be used to signal a recoverable error, note: if "raise" raises an error inheriting from "NoCatch" then the error cannot be caught

    errors can be handled with "try, catch, final" statements, a "final" block is optional but the others are mandatory

    ```
    try {
        raise Error("Uh Oh");
    } catch (error : Error) {
        console.log(error);
    } final (error : Error|void) {
        raise error;
    }
    // logs then raises

    try {
        raise ValueError("Uh Oh");
    } catch (error : Error(Error)) {
        console.log(error);
    } final (error : Error|void) {
        raise error;
    }
    // only raises

    try {
        halt; // alternately: "raise NoCatch("Uh Oh")";
    } catch (error : Error) {
        console.log("HI"); // never runs
    } final {
        console.log("error"); // never runs
    }
    // only halt will run, the error is then propagated through the try block without being handled, it will continue to move up until it reaches the top and execution halts
    ```

functions:
    declared using "func [name] (*args, **kwargs) -> Type {}"

    the return value must always be typed

    ```
    func myfunc () -> void {
        console.log("Hello, World!");
    }

    func plus2 (n : number) -> number {
        return n + 2;
    }

    func concat (s1 : str, s2 : str) -> str {
        return s1 + s2;
    }

    func with_defaults (a : number = 3, b : number = 4, c : number = 5) -> bool {
        return sqrt(a * a + b * b) == c;
    }

    console.log(with_defaults(b = 5)); // false
    ```

lists:
    declared with "[]"

    list items are seperated by ","

    may span multiple lines

    if an extra comma is present after the last item then it's ignored

    ```
    var l : list = [0, 2, 1, 4];

    var l2 : list = [
        0,
        2,
        1,
        4,
    ];
    ```

    methods:
        for "list" with type "list<T>"
        - push : {(item : T) -> void} pushes one or more items
        - pop : {() -> T} removes the last item and returns it, returns "undefined" if list is empty
        - insert : {(item : T, index : int(0,)) -> void} inserts the given item at the given index, throws if the index is out of bounds
        - remove : {(index : (0,)) -> T} removes and returns the item at the specified index, throws if the index is out of bounds

        - join : {(sep : str) -> str} returns all list items as strings joined by "sep", any non-string items are converted to strings using the common "toString" method

        - sort : {(f : (item : T, next : T) -> bool) -> void} sorts the list in place

        # note that the following are hidden methods called using syntacic sugar
        - __get : {(index : int) -> T} returns the item at index "index" when less than zero the index is interpreted as an offset from the end of the list, throws if out of bounds
        - __set : {(index : int, value : T) -> void} sets the value of the item at index "index" to "value" when less than zero the index is interpreted as an offset from the end of the list, throws if out of bounds

dicts:
    declared with "{}"

    items seperated by ","

    key value pairs seperated by ":"

    may span multiple lines

    if an extra comma is present after the last item then it's ignored

    ```
    var d : dict = {0 : "1", "2" : 3};

    var d2 : dict = {
        0 : "1",
        "2" : 3,
    }
    ```

    methods:
        for "dict" with type "dict<K, V>"
        - insert : {(key : K, value : V) -> void} adds "key" and "value" as a key value pair
        - remove : {(key : K) -> void} removes the key value pair with "key" as the key

        # note that the following are hidden methods called using syntacic sugar
        - __get : {(key : K) -> V} gets the value of key "key"
        - __set : {(key : K, value : V) -> void} acts in the same way that insert does
        ```
        var d : dict = {};

        d["a"] = 1; // syntacic sugar for "__set"
        
        console.log(d["a"]); // 1; syntacic sugar for "__get"
        ```

strings:
    declared with '"string"'

    concatenation : "string" + "other"
    repetition : "string" * count

    methods:
        - toString : {() -> str} returns the string
        
        - split : {(sep : str) -> list<str>} returns the string as a list of items seperated by "sep"

        # note that the following methods are hidden and called using syntacic sugar
        - __get : {(index : int) -> str} returns the character at index "index", when less than zero "index" is interpreted as an offset from the end of the string, throws if out of bounds
        - __add : {(other : str) -> str} string concatenation
        - __mul : {(count : int(0,)) -> str} string repetition, returns "" if "count" is zero
